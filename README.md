"Two processes of "producer" and "consumer" execute in parallel. The producer produces an item and stores it in an empty buffer and consumer consumes the buffer by simply getting the content of the buffer and printing it. The total number of buffers is three and the item produced by the producer is a message that is one character long. The character is chosen from the English alphabet letters randomly. Each new item(message) generated by the producer will be printed in a new line by the producer before it is loaded into a buffer. The printed line is prefixed by "Producer:". "
